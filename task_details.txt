Your task is to create a feed displaying the entries from a sub reddit JSON feed. There should be 10 entries per page (limit) and there should also be paging functionality showing �Next� and �Previous� links in the interface to navigate between pages.
Each entry should contain the following:
� thumbnail
� created (as readable date)
� num_comments
� author
� score
� permalink (as a link)
� title
The user should be able to click on an entry to see only that entry, and be able to read the entries text (selftext).
Bonus
� Allow user to change what sub reddit the items are fetched from
� Allow user to toggle between 5, 10 or 25 entries. When changing this, the data will be refetched from reddit.
� Allow users to read the comments on an entry. To find the comments for an entry, enter an entry and add ".json" to the url. (e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/4ck9oe/launch_of_sts129_atlantis_circa_2009.json)
Super bonus
� Present the comments in threaded structure like it is done on the reddit page. See an example here: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/756nsu/matlagningsm%C3%A5ndag_cooking_monday_09_october_2017/
Tech info
Use any javascript framework.
You can fetch entry JSON feed from any sub reddit using this url: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/{ SUBREDDIT_NAME }.json 
ex. https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden.json
Parameters this url supports are:
� limit = (number) Number of entries to fetch (default: 25)
� before = (entry id) Show entries before an entry id. (ex before: �t3_758x8e�)
� after = (entry id) Show entries after an entry id. (ex after: �t3_758x8e�)
ex. https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden.json?limit=25&after=t3_758x8e
There are properties, (after and before) in the JSON response containing entry ids which can be used for pagination. How you do this is part of the test.
All words marked in bold above are fields that exists in the JSON feed.
